# UE4Minimal

UE4 Minimal is an attempt at a Dark theme for Unreal Engine 4. Currently compatible with UE 4.20 and up. This 
theme works by replacing images in UE4's Engine/Content folder - My hope is to go full minimal with this theme and 
address the iconography of the Unreal Engine 4.

###### Changes:
* Preserved default Blueprint nodes look (You can get flat BP Nodes from the master repo)
* New Close/Minimize/Maximize buttons
* All nonflat buttons are now flat
* Fixed flickering issues for Blueprint Actions (RMB)
* Fixed flickering issues with Crash Reporter
* All PSD files removed (You can get them from the master repository anyway)

###### How to install:
1. Navigate to your `..Engine\Content` folder.

2. Make a copy of these two folders: `Editor` and `Slate` this will be your backup if you
would like to revert the theme, otherwise you'll have to reinstall the engine.

3. Download or clone the repo, and copy the `Editor` and `Slate` folders into your
`..Engine/Content` folder. You will be asked to override a few thousand files, hit yes.

4. Once all is done, open the Editor and enjoy your new Minimal theme.

This is all done in my free time, and is something I consider spending a couple months perfecting - 
So please be patient!
